You need to have CMake 3.11 installed on your computer, if no, download it from oficial website: https://cmake.org/download/

To build use the following command: <br>
&emsp; <code>mkdir -p build && cd ./build && cmake .. && make</code> <br>
Now you can run executable file from build folder.

To delete objects simply delete folder build, for instance, by using the following command from project directory:<br>
&emsp; <code>rm -rf build</code>
